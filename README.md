# Lark
A programming language with mutable syntax.
______
0.3.3: The prototyped version.

## Use
Lark is used in the following manner: `python lark [space seperated file names
to execute]` More info on use will be added shortly.

## Status
Lark is in very heavy development. As of now Lark can function fully and may be
usable for small tasks. The initial goal of making a proof-of-concept is
complete. Examples will be added soon.



## Todo
- Fix Todo
- Deal with curly brackets and equals signs in functions
- Improve parsing
- Reorder readme
- Add to "Use" section of the readme
- Deal with string conversion properly
- Work on sockets
- Add print function, figure out side effects
- Fix list parsing

## Vision
The end goal, the vision, of lark is to create a world where lark is the only
accepted programming language and is mandatory teaching in all schools. A
realistic goal is ridiculous since than when you someday finish it you'll either
be completely done with everything (which is boring and should never happen) or
you'll need to find a new goal, meaning your original one wasn't your
overarching vision in the first place.

## Praise?
- _"It's one thing to make a language that I think is trash. It's another to
implement it in a way that is harmful to the reader."_ - @aatxe on an earlier,
and much messier, version of Lark.

- _"We need to force-feed JacobEdelman some JSLint."_ - Anonymous on the
horrible JS style in an earlier version of Lark.

- _"Your language seems like total nonsense and deserves to be executed
publicly."_  - @Hypersonic upon seeing the first somewhat functioning version of
lark.

-  _"As far as I'm concerned, self-mutate is synonymous with self-mutilate in
terms of a programming language's capabilities."_ - @aatxe on Lark's mutable
syntax.

- _"Language appears to have no use to anyone. Please consider fixing this in
the next update."_ - On Github by z3t in a Lark issue.


## History:
- Version 0.0.0: Pre-Usable, mostly a rough draft of core code.
- Version 0.0.1: Core code for certain sections is done.
- Version 0.0.2: Core code is finished. It should be possible to write programs.
- Version 0.0.3: Basic programs can be created. Multiplication was created in
lark.
- Version 0.3.0: Old version of lark was completely trashed and rewritten three
times. I think. I lost count. The newest version is in python.
- Version 0.3.1: Lark is made fully usable and functioning.
- Version 0.3.2: Strings are added to Lark. All major features have now been
added to Lark.
- Version 0.3.3: Lark can be demoed and tests all work. Socket addition has
begun and a standard library has been initialized. To string methods were added.
