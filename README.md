# Lark
0.0.2
A programming language with mutable syntax.
______

## Status

Lark's name will be changing soon as it has been discovered there was already a programming language named Lark. Go figure. Lark is in very heavy development. This readme will be updated once Lark is even somewhat usable. As of now the very core of the language has been built. This is the part that does parsing and can deal with the mutable syntax. The current task it to deal with adding the basic language executer on top of which components can be added.

## Todo
- The basic language executer
- A type system
- A better readme :)
- Core types such as strings and integers
- Operators such as integer addition, integer multiplication, string slicing ect.

## Vision
The end goal, the vision, of lark is to create a world where lark is the only accepted programming language and is mandatory teaching in all schools.


## Contributors
Jacob Edelman is the leader and creator of Lark. Pull requests are welcome.

## Praise?

- _"It's one thing to make a language that I think is trash. It's another to implement it in a way that is harmful to the reader."_ - Aaron Weiss on an earlier, and much messier, version of Lark.

- _"We need to force-feed JacobEdelman some JSLint."_ - Anonymous on the horrible JS style in an earlier version of Lark.

-  _"As far as I'm concerned, self-mutate is synonymous with self-mutilate in terms of a programming language's capabilities."_ - Aaron Weiss on Lark's mutable syntax.

## History:

- Version 0.0.0: Pre-Usable, mostly a rough draft of core code.
- Version 0.0.1 (current): Core code for certain sections is done.
- Version 0.0.2 (in progress): Core code is finished. It should be possible to write programs.
