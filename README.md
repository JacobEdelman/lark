# Lark
0.3.1
A programming language with mutable syntax.
______
0.3.1: The actually working update!

## Use
Lark is used in the following manner:
`python lark [space seperated file names to execute]`
More info on use will be added shortly.

## Status

Lark's name will be changing soon as it has been discovered there was already a programming language named Lark. Go figure. Lark is in very heavy development. As of now the very core of the language has been built. This is the part that does parsing and can deal with the mutable syntax. The current task it to deal with adding the basic language executer on top of which components can be added. As of now it seems that lark is somewhat usable, although not necessarily useful. Examples will be added.



## Todo
- Fix Todo

## Vision
The end goal, the vision, of lark is to create a world where lark is the only accepted programming language and is mandatory teaching in all schools.

## Praise?

- _"It's one thing to make a language that I think is trash. It's another to implement it in a way that is harmful to the reader."_ - @aatxe on an earlier, and much messier, version of Lark.

- _"We need to force-feed JacobEdelman some JSLint."_ - Anonymous on the horrible JS style in an earlier version of Lark.

- _"Your language seems like total nonsense and deserves to be executed publicly."_  - @HyperSonic upon seeing the first somewhat functioning version of lark.
- 
-  _"As far as I'm concerned, self-mutate is synonymous with self-mutilate in terms of a programming language's capabilities."_ - @aatxe on Lark's mutable syntax.

- _"Language appears to have no use to anyone. Please consider fixing this in the next update."_ - On Github by z3t in a Lark issue. 

## History:


- Version 0.0.0: Pre-Usable, mostly a rough draft of core code.
- Version 0.0.1: Core code for certain sections is done.
- Version 0.0.2: Core code is finished. It should be possible to write programs.
- Version 0.0.3: Basic programs can be created. Multiplication was created in lark.
- Version 0.3.0: Old version of lark was completely trashed and rewritten three times. I think. I lost count. The newest version is in python.
